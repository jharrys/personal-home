# import command

mongoimport --host 127.8.13.130 -u johnnie -p password --db booknook --collection books --jsonArray ./books.json

# export command

mongoexport --host 127.3.207.130 -u admin -p T2jGp-zPn3uG -db booknook --collection books --jsonArray -o ./mybooks.json

- if the collection books doesn't exist it will create it
- normally each json object is separated by a new line, the jsonArray tells it to accept it as an JS array
- for -u use admin (not sure i added johnnie in another version)
- no need for rhc —port-forward

# To find the IP (127.8.13.130 in the above example)

* go to the rockmongo web (i.e., https://booknook-johnnie.rhcloud.com/rockmongo/)
* enter the user admin but give it a wrong password
* the error message will show you the ip address rockmongo is trying to connect to for the mongodb
* there should be an easier way but it’s the way i found right now
