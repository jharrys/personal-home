## All Inclusive Rate

* usually $20/hr higher than market rate

## Market Rate
* if travel is required then the following applies:
    * market rate is $80/hr, then *all inclusive rate* is $100/hr
    * so T&E (Travel & Expense) is $20/hr
        * T&E == flight, food, hotel, car, public, transport
        * ensure they spell out what T&E is defined in their company
        * **check to see if hotel has corporate rate for company**

## T&M (Time & Material)
* burn rate: the rate per month the company expects you to log against T&M.
