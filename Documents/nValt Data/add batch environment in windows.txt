1. Create a .bat or .cmd file with your DOSKEY commands.

1. Run regedit and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER -> Software -> Microsoft -> Command Processor

1. Add String Value entry with the name AutoRun and the full path of your .bat/.cmd file.

        For example, %USERPROFILE%\alias.cmd
        Replacing the initial segment of the path with %USERPROFILE% is useful for syncing among multiple machines.

1. Note that the $* syntax works after a directory string as well as an executable which takes in arguments. So in the above example, the user-defined command dropbox research points to the same directory as research.

1. It is a good idea to include a command that allows for convenient editing of the env.cmd file. See alias above. If you are in a cmd session, enter cmd to restart cmd and reload the env.cmd file.

Registry command

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
"AutoRun"="%USERPROFILE%\\Dropbox\\dev\\misc\\env.cmd"
```

In depth example


```
@echo off

:: Temporary system path at cmd startup

set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\"

:: Add to path by command

DOSKEY add_python26=set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Python26\"
DOSKEY add_python33=set PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Python33\"

:: Commands

DOSKEY ls=dir /B
DOSKEY sublime=sublime_text $*  
    ::sublime_text.exe is name of the executable. By adding a temporary entry to system path, we don't have to write the whole directory anymore.
DOSKEY gsp="C:\Program Files (x86)\Sketchpad5\GSP505en.exe"
DOSKEY alias=notepad %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\alias.cmd

:: Common directories

DOSKEY dropbox=cd "%USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\$*"
DOSKEY research=cd %USERPROFILE%\Dropbox\Research\
```
