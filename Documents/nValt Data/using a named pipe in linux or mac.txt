### Pipes or Named Pipes are files that allow inter-process communication by connecting the output of one process to the input of another

        > cd tmp
        > mkfifo pipe1
        > echo “John” > pipe1
        
this shell will block until the 2nd shell reads the data
        
In another shell

        > cd tmp
        > while read line; do echo “Hello, ‘$line’”; done<pipe1
