# Excellent reference for [homebrew](http://formalfriday.club/2015/01/05/creating-your-own-homebrew-tap-and-formula.html)

# Terminology
What we need to do is create a **tap** (Github repository) that contains a **formula** (install script) that adds a **Keg** (downloaded script) to our **Cellar** (list of locally installed scripts).


# Adding a tap (repository)
* Based on a repository in github
* A tap is basically a github repository
* username refers to the github username, in my case jharrys
* tap refers to the name of the repository, prefixed with **homebrew-**

        brew tap username/tap
        
# Create your own keg
* Create a github repository
* Tag it in the form of 1.0.0 - github automatically makes it into a release with a downloadable link

        $ git tag 1.0.0
        $ git push --tags
        
* Use this downloadable link to create the brew (example below)

        https://github.com/jharrys/myfirstbrew/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz
        
* execute following create command

        $ brew create https://github.com/jharrys/myfirstbrew/archive/1.0.0.tar.gz
        
* this will create a file /usr/local/Library/Formula/myfirstbrew.rb
* the create command will spawn and $EDITOR for you to edit the rb file
* remove all template comments
* update the **homepage** url to be a valid url to your homepage
* make sure the sha1 is correct
* save and test by doing

        $ brew install myfirstbrew
        OR
        $ brew reinstall myfirstbrew
        
* should install from your cache

# Create a tap (repository)
* Create a new repository in your github profile
* Name the tab with a prefix of **homebrew-**, example:

        homebrew-harris
        
* The tap is named **harris**
* Clone new **homebrew-harris** repository to your local machine (i.e., ~/tmp/homebrew-harris)
* Add a keg to it by:
    
        $ cp /usr/local/Library/Formula/myfirstbrew.rb ~/tmp/homebrew-harris/myfirstbrew.rb
        
* commit and push to the homebrew-harris repository
