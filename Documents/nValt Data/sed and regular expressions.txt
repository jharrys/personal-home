### how to negate word matches; negative word matches

1. use the [^] syntax, but with the word in parenthesis - without parenthesis ^ applies to a character
2. had project where I wanted to match a line: log4j.appender.someText.File=/path/to/file *but* did not want to match a line if it was: log4j.appender.LOGFILE.File=/path/to/file

        sed -n '/log4j\.appender\.[^(LOGFILE)].*\..*File=/p'
        
explanation:

        \.  == escapes the period so it simply means period
        .* == find 0 or more alphanumeric charactor
        /p == print what matched
