In IT non-repudiation is about having proof that an author did, in fact, author (i.e., signature, document, etc). 
__More importantly, this proof can be verified without the author's consent.__

* Asymmetric Cryptography allows for verification of author WITHOUT author consent.
    * A public key alone doesn't mean much, you still need to reliably associate a public key with an owner (author)
    * This is where _certificates_ become important; _certificates_ contain identity along with the public key.
    * _certificates_ are signed by a Certification Authority (CA). Since this falls under non-repudiation as well, then the CA must be honest and have a good reputation
    * X.509 Certificates have a non-repudiation bit in the keyusage attribute, to identify the intended use of this key (see rfc 5280)
