1. installed the iscan (see if i can remove it - have it in my downloads)
2. installed sane
3. installed xsane (see if i can remove it)
4. check dnf install log for any others i installed
5. it uses the /etc/sane.d/epson2.conf configuration
6. to get it working i modified /etc/sane.d/epson2.conf and added entry “net 10.0.0.203” right to the scanner - autodetect is not working
