I found I needed to use plugins that weren’t tied to a specific pom file. 

For example the versions-maven-plugin by org.codehaus.mojo. This plugin is used to version projects through their pom files..

I tried a method to download dependencies. I tried `maven dependency:get` without success.

`mvn dependency:get` wouldn’t work because it wouldn’t register the plugin correctly in my m2 repository. I decided that **dependency:get** is good for stand-alone downloading.

I used `mvn install:install-file` to install the plugin into my m2 repository; this seemed to work well and register it correctly.

For this particular issue I still couldn’t get the plugin to work, so I did the following trouble shooting exercise:

Determined effective pom
: `mvn help:effective-pom` showed me that for the project I was using the versions-maven-plugin was already defined in a parent pom (Spring Boot). In the latest version of Spring Boot (1.5.1-RELEASE) they made it into a variable that I could override. The variable was called `versions-maven-plugin.version`. So I overrode it with the command line -Dversions-maven-plugin.version=2.3.

Override in project’s pom
: The other way is to define it in the project’s plugins section with the version you want.
