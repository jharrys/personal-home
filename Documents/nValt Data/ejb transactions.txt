## MANDATORY
A MANDATORY method is guaranteed to always be executed in a transaction. However, it's the caller's job to take care of suppling the transaction. If the caller attempts to invoke the method outside of a transaction, then the container will block the call and throw them an exception. The MANDATORY behaviour states that an existing opened transaction must already exist. If it doesn't an exception will be thrown by the container.

## REQUIRED
A REQUIRED method is guaranteed to always be executed in a transaction. If the caller attempts to invoke the method outside of a transaction, the container will start a transaction, execute the method, then commit the transaction.

## REQUIRES_NEW
A REQUIRES_NEW method is guaranteed to always be executed in a transaction. If the caller attempts to invoke the method inside or outside of a transaction, the container will still start a transaction, execute the method, then commit the transaction. Any transaction the caller may have in progress will be suspended before the method execution then resumed afterward. The newly created transaction outcome will not affect the outer transaction outcome. The existing transaction outcome will also not impact the newly created transaction outcome: They behave independently.

## NEVER
A NEVER method is guaranteed to never be executed in a transaction. However, it's the caller's job to ensure there is no transaction. If the caller attempts to invoke the method inside of a transaction, then the container will block the call and throw them an exception. The NEVER behaviour states that an existing opened transaction must not already exist. If an opened transaction already exists the container will throw an exception.

## NOT_SUPPORTED
A NOT_SUPPORTED method is guaranteed to never be executed in a transaction. If the caller attempts to invoke the method inside of a transaction, the container will suspend the caller's transaction, execute the method, then resume the caller's transaction. The NOT_SUPPORTED behaviour will execute outside of the scope of any transaction. If an opened transaction already exists it will be paused and later resumed after method execution.

## SUPPORTS
A SUPPORTS method is guaranteed to adopt the exact transactional state of the caller. These methods can be invoked by caller's inside or outside of a transaction. The container will do nothing to change that state. The SUPPORTS behaviour will execute in the scope of a transaction if an opened transaction already exists. If there isn't an already opened transaction the method will execute anyway but in a non-transactional way.

Per EJB 3.0 the default transaction attribute for all EJB 3.0 applications is REQUIRED. The default transaction attribute for EJB 2.1, 2.0 and 1.1 applications is vendor specific.
