Every time there was a kernel update to Fedora I had to run VBoxLinuxAdditions.run as root.

I wanted a way to do it automatically.


### Option #1

The documentation says to use dkms package to do this.

1. Install all the requirements for additions on the linux guest (kernel-devel, headers, gcc, etc)
1. Install dkms BEFORE installing VBoxLinuxAdditions
1. Install VBoxLinuxAdditions

**DKMS should recompile automatically whenever the kernel changes.**

*It wasn’t working for me. Possibly installed DKMS after.*

### Option #2

1. As root, run 

        rcvboxadd setup
    
This should setup file under /etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd - which will run ‘vbovadd setup’ whenever on startup it finds that the kernel has changed.

2. If for some reason the above command won’t run or you can’t find it, simply follow these steps:
    
        touch /etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd
        vim /etc/kernel/postinst.d/vboxadd
        
        #!/bin/sh
        test -d “/lib/modules/${1}/build” || exit 0
        KERN_DIR=“lib/modules/${1}/build” MODULE_DIR=“/lib/modules/${1}/misc” /sbin/rcvboxadd quicksetup
        exit 0
