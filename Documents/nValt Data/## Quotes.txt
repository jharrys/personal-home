Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
~ Albert Einstein

Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.

Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.
- Helen Keller

If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.

If you are happy in the moment with her grab it and use it for all it's worth.
- Sara Curry, March 5, 2013

When John and I first fell in love I remember for the first time in my life i thought 'if everything I've been thru has brought me to this moment, this time, in my life it has all been worth it'. I remember the giddy excitement and it was better than anything in this world. It was all at once better than any drug, better than any feeling and I felt closer to God than I've ever felt. 
- Sara Curry, March 5, 2013 - John is her husband.

There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'
- Isaac Asimov

It's hard to say hello because it might be goodbye. It's hard to say I'm okay because sometimes I'm not. But it's easy to say I miss you coz I know that I really do. So I am sending you these flowers to let you know how much I love you.

They were viewed very much like castles, I suppose: as crumbling, obsolete relics, with no real modern function other than as tourist attractions. But when the skies darkened and the nation called, both re-awoke to the meaning of their existence. One shielded our bodies, the other, our souls.
- David Allen Forbes, World War Z in the Providence of Bohemia by Max Brooks

Anyone who imagines that bliss is normal is going to waste a lot of time running around shouting that he's been robbed. The fact is that most putts don't drop, most beef is tough, most children grow up to be just people, most successful marriages require a high degree of mutual toleration, and most jobs are more often dull than otherwise. Life is like an old time journey...delays, sidetracks, smoke, dust, cinders, and jolts, interspersed only occasionally by beautiful vistas, and thrilling bursts of speed. The trick is to thank the Lord for letting you have the ride.
- President Gordon B. Hinckley

He who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead...
- Albert Einstein

Everything is determined…by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables, or cosmic dust—we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible piper.
- Albert Einstein 

Euclid's first common notion is this: Things which are equal to the same things are equal to each other. That's a rule of mathematical reasoning and its true because it works - has done and always will do. In his book Euclid says this is self evident. You see there it is even in that 2000 year old book of mechanical law it is the self evident truth that things which are equal to the same things are equal to each other.  
- Abraham Lincoln (2012 Movie Lincoln)

I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours and bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me, you must allow me to do it, alone, as I must and you alone Mary, you alone may lighten this burden or render it intolerable as you choose.
- Abraham Lincoln to his wife when she bitterly and angrily condemns her husband for letting their son choose his own path (2012 Movie Lincoln)  

A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll... it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice about the swamps and dessert and chasm that you'll encounter along the way. If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp... What's the use of knowing True North? 
- Abraham Lincoln (2012 Movie Lincoln) - to Thaddeus Stevens, who although has great intent and passion for truth and correctness must temper this in order to provide leadership
- My own words, clean up ... True North must be tempered by reality in order to navigate (lead) a people in the direction of True North, and the route is not always direct. Patience and most of all a view of time is necessary.
 
I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.

A warrior may change his metal, but not his heart.

Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.
- Mark Twain

We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it - and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again, and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.
- Mark Twain

It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, and the prudence never to practice either of them.
- Mark Twain

When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.
- Mark Twain

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.
- Mark Twain

The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and then starting on the first one.
- Mark Twain

Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it.

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.
- C.A.R. Hoare (British computer scientist, winner of the 1980 Turing Award) 

“If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.”
- Edsger Dijkstra (Dutch computer scientist, winner of the 1972 Turing Award) 

“Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.”
- Bill Gates (co-founder of Microsoft) 

“Nine people can’t make a baby in a month.” (regarding the addition of more programmers to get a project completed faster)
- Fred Brooks (American computer scientist, winner of the 1999 Turing Award) 

“Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.”
- Brian W. Kernighan (Canadian computer scientist, co-author of “C programming language”) 

“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”
- Martin Golding 

 “C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.”

 “Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.”
- Eric S. Raymond (American programmer, open source software advocate, author of “The Cathedral and the Bazaar”) 

 “Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.”
- Linus Torvalds (Finnish American, software engineer and hacker, principal force behind the development of the Linux kernel) 

“Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.”
- Rich Cook 

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
- Martin Fowler (author and speaker on software development) 

 “Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?’”
- Steve McConnell (author of many software engineering books including “Code Complete”) 

“The problem with using C++ … is that there’s already a strong tendency in the language to require you to know everything before you can do anything.”
- Larry Wall (developer of the Perl language) 

“People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on each other, like a wall of mini stones.”
- Donald Knuth (computer scientist) 

“One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.”
- Ken Thompson (computer scientist, early developer of UNIX OS) 

“Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.”
- Alan Kay (American computer scientist) 

“Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.”
- Ralph Johnson (computer scientist) 

“Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.”
- Michael Sinz 

“If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, then the first woodpecker that came along wound destroy civilization.”

- Abraham Lincoln

It is strange to think, I haven't seen you since a month. I have seen the new moon, but not you. I have seen sunsets and sunrises, but nothing of your beautiful face. The pieces of my broken heart are so small that they could be passed through the eye of a needle. I miss you like the sun misses the flower; like the sun misses the flower in the depths of winter. Instead of beauty to direct its light to, the heart hardens like the frozen world your absence has banished me to. I next compete in the city of Paris, I will find it empty and in the winter if you are not there. Hope guides me, that is what gets me through the day and especially the night. The hope that after you're gone from my sight, it will not be the last time that I look upon you.  
- William, A Knights Tale in a letter to Jocelyn
