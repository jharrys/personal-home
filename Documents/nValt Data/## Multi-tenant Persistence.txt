"Dedicated Database" approach

* Multitenant tables
* Tenant discriminator column(s) used by multitenant tables
* Allows application to be re-used for multiple tenants and have all their data co-located
* All tenants share the same schema without being aware of one another
* All tenants can use non-multitenant entity types
* Basic principles:
    * application instances handle multiple tenants
    * caching has to be isolated for every tenant by ORM layer (think of - persistence context per tenant)
