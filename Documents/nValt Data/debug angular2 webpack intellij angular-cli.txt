# See this stack exchange answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39348213/how-to-debug-angular-2-app-using-angular-cli-webpack/39518508

# Otherwise
1. webpack uses in-memory transpiled typescript to javascript and also keeps the source maps in-memory
2. start your app
3. navigate to it and call main.map (i.e., http://localhost:4200/main.map)
4. look for any .ts files in the output and record the URI which is something like “webpack:////Users/lpjharri/project”
5. you probably already have a run/debug config under intellij for this project, open it’s configuration setting
6. if you don’t create a new one using the “Javascript Debug” template
7. in the section called “Remote URLs of local files (optional)” - map the local src dir and/or files to the webpack in-memory path
    1. example in my project: full project path is /Users/lpjharri/project
    2. angular2 app starts at /Users/lpjharri/project/client/src/app
    3. since index.html lives under src and everything maps 1 to 1 in file structure starting at src just map the src directory
    4. /Users/lpjharri/project/client/src == webpack:////Users/lpjharri/project/client/src
    5. Note the 4 back slashes for a Unix path (3 back slashes for DOS path followed by hard drive reference like C)
