# Security exception due to trust between weblogic domains

        Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.SecurityException: [Security:090398]Invalid Subject: principals=[weblogic, Administrators]> 

# I get this even running the same domain but one from command line and the other from within Intellij - it’s because the security certificates are not being loaded from within Intellij

Add the following VM option wherever Intellij executes weblogic:

        -Dweblogic.security.SSL.trustedCAKeyStore="/Users/lpjharri/local/appservers/wls-12.1.3/wlserver/server/lib/cacerts"
