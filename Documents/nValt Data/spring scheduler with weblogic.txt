## My requirement is to run a method from a spring bean service on a timer.

[Spring Scheduling Reference](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html)

*  The app is not configured through normal spring boot configuration (annotations) because the app container is weblogic
* Need to configure the library through spring xml.
* If you need to do it through spring-boot it is much much simpler (see https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/ for a quick answer and nice spring guide)

        <task:scheduled-tasks scheduler="myScheduler">
          <task:scheduled ref="ProcessManagerService" method="cleanup" fixed-delay="18750"/>
        </task:scheduled-tasks>
        
        <task:scheduler id="myScheduler" pool-size="10"/>

* **myScheduler** is an arbitrary name. It’s used as a reference to create a pool of threads and when referenced by *scheduled-tasks* uses those threads for your scheduled bean.
* **ProcessManagerService** is annotated with @Service
* **cleanup** has to return void and require no arguments
