The scope of a transaction refers to the environment in which the transaction is performed. 

WebLogic Server **supports transactions on standalone servers, between non-clustered servers, between clustered servers within a domain, and between domains**. 

To enable inter-domain transaction support, see Configuring Secure Inter-Domain and Intra-Domain Transaction Communication.
