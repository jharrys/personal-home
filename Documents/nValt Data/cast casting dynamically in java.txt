I want to cast dynamically in Java.

If I have an object of type Object and it’s type as a string in another variable as in this example:

public void convertMeToRealType(Object o, String stringType) {
    Class class = Class.forName(stringType);
    Object newObject = class.cast(o);
}

It’s not true dynamic casting, but it lets you know that the object can be cast to newObject and the newObject can be placed into
some array of stringType’s super type.
