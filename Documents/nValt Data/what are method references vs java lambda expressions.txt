Method references are a way to concisely reference a method that meets certain specs (an existing functional interface). More importantly, they are used in place of closures or lambda expressions.

I used the word “concisely” because it’s somewhat synctatic sugar … really cuts down on having to write out a lambda expression.

Method references are not invocations of the method, but are references.

**The Lambda Expressions (Closures) way:**

        // Setup list
        List<Jedi> jedis = asList(new Jedi("Obi-wan", 80),
        new Jedi("Anakin", 25),
        new Jedi("Yoda", 500));
        
        // Using the closure
        List<String> names = map(jedi -> jedi.getName() , jedis);
        
**The Method Reference way:**

        // Setup list
        List<Jedi> jedis = asList(new Jedi("Obi-wan", 80),
        new Jedi("Anakin", 25),
        new Jedi("Yoda", 500));
        
        // Using method reference
        List<String> names = map(Jedi::getName , jedis);

**The closure way:**

        List<Integer> numbers = asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
        forEach(n -> { System.out.println(n); }, numbers);
        
**The method reference way:**

        List<Integer> numbers = asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9);
        forEach(System.out::println}, numbers);

We can use lambda expressions to implement functional interfaces. However we can implement functional interfaces by using method references.

**This is important if we have pre-existing code (legacy code) that we want to use to implement a functional interface.**

This is a functional interface:

        public interface Predicate<T> {
            public void test(T t);
        }
