If two files are very similar, then the context diff will show many replicated contentx. In 1999, GNU diff propoesed the Unified diff, it merges contents of f1 and f2.
We add a -u option to diff
$ diff -u f1 f2
The result
     --- f1 2012-08-29 16:45:41.000000000 +0800 　　+++ f2 2012-08-29 16:45:51.000000000 +0800 　　@@ -1,7 +1,7 @@ 　　 a 　　 a 　　 a 　　-a 　　+b 　　 a 　　 a 　　 a
The first part is still the file information
     --- f1 2012-08-29 16:45:41.000000000 +0800 　　+++ f2 2012-08-29 16:45:51.000000000 +0800
"---" indicates file before change,"+++" indicates file after change
The second part uses two @ to indicate the change location
     @@ -1,7 +1,7 @@
the -1,7 consists of 3 parts, '-' indicates the first file (f1), '1' indicates line 1,'7' indicates consecutive 7 lines. The meaning of this expression is that the following is the 7 lines of the first file starting from line 1.
"+1,7" means 7 lines of the second file starting from line 1.
The third part shows the content changes
      a 　　 a 　　 a 　　-a 　　+b 　　 a 　　 a 　　 a
except the changes, it will also show 3 lines in the file before and after the change. It will merge the surrounding content, that's why it is called unified diff. There is a mark character at the beginning of each line. If it's blank, then no change, if it's '-', then the line is deleted, if it's '+', then the line is added.
