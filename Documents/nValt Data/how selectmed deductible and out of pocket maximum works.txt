# Deductibles

Mostly applies to medical procedures or visits.

If a family hits their __family deductible__ then it’s like every individual has met their individual deductible.

Otherwise, an individuals deductible applies.

Example:
John has a medical procedure and has to fork out $400 for the service. The rest of the family has not had any procedures, so the family deductibe has met $400 of the $1050 it has to meet. 

Since he met the individual deductible of $350, the future procedures for John are taken care of by the insurance, he only needs to worry about the copay.

The rest of the family members still continue to pay until they reach their own deductible of $350.

OR

Until all the deductibles across all the individuals hits the $1050 mark.

## 2015

* Individual : $350
* Family : $350 * 3 = $1050 (no more than 3 members are expected to pay to meet the deductible)

# Out Of Pocket Maximum (OOPM)

OOPM applies to prescriptions as well as the rest of whatever you pay from your pocket for medical services.

If a family hits their __family oopm__ then it’s like every individual has met their individual OOPM.

Otherwise, an individuals oopm applies.

Example:
John has a medical procedure then between office visits and prescriptions he spends $4000 out of pocket. The rest of the family has not had any procedures, so the family oopm has met $4000 of the $6000 it has to meet. 

Since he met the individual oopm of $3000, the future prescriptions for John are taken care of by the insurance 100%.

The rest of the family members still continue to pay until they reach their own deductible of $3000.

OR

Until all the deductibles across all the individuals hits the $6000 mark.

## 2015

* Individual : $3000
* Family : $3000 * 2 = $6000 (no more than 2 members are expected to pay to meet the oopm)
