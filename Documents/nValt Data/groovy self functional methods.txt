Groovy has extension classes and methods. These are normal java classes that are used to extend other classes with additional functionality without having their source code.

For example you can extend the functionality of Java’s String class by using an extension class.

To load the extension classes groovy requires you to declare these methods/classes in a certain way inside the META-INF/services directory. They have to be present on the classpath at runtime.

You can have static and instance methods, but they have to be declared in different classes (they can’t live together).

***
The first argument of the method (static or instance) corresponds to the receiver of the message, in other words the extended instance.

E.g.,

```
class StaticStringExtension {
    static String greeting(String self) {
        ‘Hello, world!’
    }
}
```

The parameter to greeting, self, refers to the instance of the String which greeting() is being called on.

It is not used, hence it would be called:

```
String.greeting() // which results in “Hello, world!”
```
