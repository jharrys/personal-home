Use diskutil for this.

1. Use the graphical Disk Utility to get the CoreStorage UUID of the Volume
    Open disk utility, look for the disk (i.e., Apricorn Padlock), then right click on the volume (knox) and choose “info”. Look for the value for CoreStorage UUID …  mine was something like “D22EC3B8-6A29-43CD-94F5-42B3791CFB84”
3. Use the command line to make the password change (it’s not enabled through the GUI)
4. **diskutil coreStorage changeVolumePassphrase D22EC3B8-6A29-43CD-94F5-42B3791CFB84**
5. It will prompt you for the old password and then new password

All done.
