Click HELP => Find Actions => “switch ide boot jdk”

this will pop up a dialog box that let’s you choose which jdk/jre and will restart it.

There is an IDEA plugin to install an Intellij jdk/jre from their repository:

Install the JB SDK Bintray Downloader plugin (screenshot).
Start the IDE, use Help | Find Action (Ctrl+Shift+A or Cmd+Shift+A on Mac), type "Get JB SDK", press Enter.
Select the version to install, the higher the number after b, the more recent is the version. It makes sense to install the most recent version or the version you were asked to try by JetBrains staff.
Click the Download button and wait until the file with JetBrains Runtime is downloaded.
Once download is finished, click the Install button, the file will be unpacked into idea.config.path\jdks location and the full path to this JDK will be saved into idea.config.path\<product>.jdk file, for example: C:\Users\serge\.IntelliJIdea2017.1\config\jdks\jbsdk8u152b819.1_windows_x64. IDE will automatically restart.
Verify via About dialog that the new runtime is used. Notice the vendor (should be JetBrains s.r.o) and the release number (should correspond to the number after b in the file you've downloaded).
If the JDK version in the About dialog doesn't match or didn't change, see below. Most likely, you have an environment variable configured which has the priority over the <product>.jdk file. Remove any environment variables affecting IDE runtime selection and restart.
All platforms: switch between installed runtimes

Start the IDE, use Help | Find Action (Ctrl+Shift+A or Cmd+Shift+A on Mac), type "Switch IDE Boot JDK", press Enter.
Switch IDE Boot JDK dialog appears. Select the version from the drop-down or click "…" entry to specify the custom location. This location has to point to the JDK installation home directory (like c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_112 or /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_112.jdk/Contents/Home/ or /usr/lib/jvm/open-jdk).
Please note that using JetBrains Runtime is highly recommended for performance and stability reasons (it fixes many known OpenJDK and Oracle JDK bugs).
Selected location is stored inside the idea.config.path\<product>.jdk file, should you need to revert to the default behavior in case of any problem (like when IDE no longer starts), delete this file or modify the installation path inside.
Windows

JDK (JetBrains Runtime) is bundled with all the product installers and it's recommended that you will use the provided JDK version unless there are any specific issues. Since 2017.1 version 64-bit JDK is bundled by default on all the systems (32-bit JDK can be downloaded on Windows by the installer if needed).

JetBrains Runtime (based on OpenJDK) can be also downloaded separately, but you normally don't need to do it. 

<product>.exe uses this JDK search sequence:

IDEA_JDK / PHPSTORM_JDK / WEBIDE_JDK / PYCHARM_JDK / RUBYMINE_JDK / CLION_JDK / DATAGRIP_JDK environment variable (depends on the product, WEBIDE_JDK applies to both WebStorm and PhpStorm before version 2016.1)

idea.config.path\<product>.jdk file
..\jre directory
system Registry
JDK_HOME environment variable
JAVA_HOME environment variable
<product>64.exe uses this JDK search sequence:

IDEA_JDK_64/ PHPSTORM_JDK_64 / WEBIDE_JDK_64 / PYCHARM_JDK_64 / RUBYMINE_JDK_64 / CLION_JDK_64 / DATAGRIP_JDK_64 environment variable
idea.config.path\<product>64.jdk file
..\jre64 directory
system Registry
JDK_HOME environment variable
JAVA_HOME environment variable
It’s also possible to start the IDE with <product>.bat file located in the bin directory, it uses the following JDK search sequence:

IDEA_JDK / PHPSTORM_JDK / WEBIDE_JDK / PYCHARM_JDK / RUBYMINE_JDK / CLION_JDK / DATAGRIP_JDK environment variable (depends on the product)
idea.config.path\<product>64.jdk file
idea.config.path\<product>.jdk file
..\jre64 directory
..\jre directory
JDK_HOME environment variable
JAVA_HOME environment variable
Environment variable must point to the JDK installation home directory, for example:
c:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_112
The actual JDK version used by the IDE can be verified in Help | About dialog (open any project to access the menu).
Define IDEA_JDK / PHPSTORM_JDK / WEBIDE_JDK / PYCHARM_JDK / RUBYMINE_JDK / CLION_JDK / DATAGRIP_JDK variable depending on the product to override the default version from IDE_HOME\jre.
Use Rapid Environment Editor to add/edit the variables, it will detect incorrect paths.
Linux

Starting from IntelliJ IDEA 2016 and the most recent versions of the lightweight IDEs, we are bundling custom JRE with Linux distributions, just like we've been doing for Mac. Our custom JRE is based on OpenJDK and includes the most up to date fixes to provide better user experience on Linux (like font rendering improvements and HiDPI support).
Boot JDK path is stored in the <product>.jdk file located in the config folder. It can be modified either via the Change IDE boot JDK action or by manually editing .jdk file (if you can't start the IDE to change it via an action).
It's recommended to use the bundled JRE (if available). In case you have any issues with the bundled version, you can switch to the latest version of Oracle JDK or OpenJDK available for your system (OpenJDK 1.6 is not supported, please use 1.7 or later versions, JDK 1.8 is recommended and older Java versions are not supported starting from IntelliJ IDEA 16).
Check bin/<product>.sh file for the JDK search order, it's similar to Windows in terms of the environment variable names. It's a legacy way to adjust the boot jdk, use it for older product versions. Consider using <product>.jdk file instead (see above), so that your modifications can survive IDE updates/re-installation.
Check this answer if you need to install the JDK manually on Linux.
If you have problems with ugly fonts, please see this thread comments for the tips.
Help | About will show the actual JDK version.
Mac OS X

Our latest IDE versions come with the bundled custom JDK 8 which contains the fixes for most known OpenJDK and Oracle JDK bugs. Should you need to use a different Java version, please refer to this blog post.
If you override IDE JDK version, its path is stored in <product>.jdk file located in the config folder (idea.jdk for IntelliJ IDEA, pycharm.jdk for PyCharm, etc). Delete this file or change the path inside the file manually in case IDE no longer starts and you can't change it via the menu.
If IDE doesn't start and this file doesn't exist, create it manually and specify Java path to use (Java home location), for example:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_112.jdk
