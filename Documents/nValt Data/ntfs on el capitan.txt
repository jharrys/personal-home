# Troubleshooting

1. If it won't mount check the logs under /var/log/mount-ntfs-3g.log
2. if you get an error like "dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/gettext/lib/libintl.8.dylib"
    1. do "brew uninstall ntfs-3g"
    2. followed by "brew install ntfs-3g"
    3. all the symlinks will still work, now try reconnecting the drive and mounting - should work
