HWCIR Managed Server Instance

* Use Weblogic web console to create new managed server
* Names of new managed servers should be same as the directory name in filesystem
* Located under /usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/SERVER-INSTANCES-HERE
* hwapp represents the Weblogic instance (i.e., 12.1.1 or 12.1.3)
    * hwapp is Weblogic version 12.1.1
    * hwapp-ver is Weblogic version 12.1.3
* copy an existing managed server
    * cp -ar /usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/existing /usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/new
    * cd /usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/new
    * remove all files except
        * hwcir-properties
        * ihcstartscript.sh
        * security
        * startManagedWebLogic.sh
        * stop.sh
* If you have multiple managed servers on different systems put those in the right place (i.e., screening1, screening2)
    * directory names should match under file system so example:
    * lpv-hwverapp01:/usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/screening1
    * lpv-hwverapp02:/usr/local/beaapps/hwapp/servers/screening2
    * both directories match the name you created in the web console
