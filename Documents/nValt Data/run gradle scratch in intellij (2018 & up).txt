# Setup Groovy globally
* open **module settings**
* under **Global Libraries** add groovy and point it to (e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/groovy/2.5.2/libexec/lib/groovy-2.5.2.jar)

# Assign Groovy to a specific module
* in **module settings**
* under **Global Libraries** right-click the new groovy library and select **add to modules**
* select the one you want, it doesn’t matter for scratches as you can select which module the scratch will use

# Create a run configuration for the scratch
* right-click on the scratch and choose **run**
* cancel the run
* now go into it’s configuration: select which module to use (the one you add above); remove the **build** from the Before Launch configuration, as it’s not part of the project, really.
