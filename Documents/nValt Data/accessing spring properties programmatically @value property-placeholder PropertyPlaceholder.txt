## Accessing a Spring property programmatically to use in debug statements etc

* Add this to your spring.xml
  * ignore-unresolvable is needed so that spring will continue resolving for other xml files and not stop here
  * can use “classpath:” or “file:”

        <context:property-placeholder location="classpath:foo.properties" ignore-unresolvable=“true” />

* Add this to the class you want to access properties from

        @Value(“${jdbc.url}”)
        private String jdbc-url;
        
        // OR
        
        @Value(“${jdbc.url:ADEFAULTURL}”)

* Note: to make the DEFAULT work I also had to include in the same class, a class level annotation:
        
        @PropertySource(
        value = {"file:hwcir-properties/processor/processor.properties"},
        ignoreResourceNotFound = true)
