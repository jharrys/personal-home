EA Concepts

• System complexity—Organizations were spending more and more money building IT systems; and
• Poor business alignment—Organizations were finding it more and more difficult to keep those increasingly expensive IT systems aligned with business need.

• The Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architectures—Although self-described as a framework, is actually more accurately defined as a taxonomy
• The Open Group Architectural Framework (TOGAF)—Although called a framework, is actually more accurately defined as a process
• The Federal Enterprise Architecture—Can be viewed as either an implemented enterprise architecture or aproscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise architecture
• The Gartner Methodology—Can be best described as an enterprise architectural practice

DoD uses TAFIM (Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management) - introduced 1994
next is FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework)

Problems to Solve

• IT systems that have become unmanageably complex and increasingly costly to maintain.
• IT systems that are hindering the organization's ability to respond to current, and future, market conditions in a timely and cost-effective manner.
• Mission-critical information that is consistently out-of-date and/or just plain wrong.
• A culture of distrust between the business and technology sides of the organization.

IEEE-1471-2000 Definitions

architect—One whose responsibility is the design of an architecture and the creation of an architectural description
architectural artifact—A specific document, report, analysis, model, or other tangible that contributes to an architectural description
architectural description*—A collection of products (artifacts) to document an architecture
architectural framework—A skeletal structure that defines suggested architectural artifacts, describes how those artifacts are related to each other, and provides generic definitions for what those artifacts might look like
architectural methodology—A generic term that can describe any structured approach to solving some or all of the problems related to architecture
architectural process—A defined series of actions directed to the goal of producing either an architecture or an architectural description
architectural taxonomy—A methodology for organizing and categorizing architectural artifacts
architecture*—The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution
enterprise architecture—An architecture in which the system in question is the whole enterprise, especially the business processes, technologies, and information systems of the enterprise

Gartner Architecture

The best summation of the Gartner practice that I have heard is the following:

Architecture is a verb, not a noun.

What does it mean to say that architecture is a verb, not a noun? It means that it is the ongoing process of creating, maintaining, and, especially, leveraging an enterprise architecture that gives an enterprise architecture its vitality. An architecture that is just a bunch of stiff artifacts that sit in a corner gathering dust is useless, regardless of how sophisticated your taxonomy is for categorizing those artifacts or how brilliant your process is that guided their development.
