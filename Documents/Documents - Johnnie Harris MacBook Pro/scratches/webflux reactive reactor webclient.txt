how to configure the spring-boot WebClient

channel-timeout: the time it takes for a connection to be established, otherwise drops
read-timeout: the timeout occurs when no data has been read for this amount of time
write-timeout: the timeout occurs when a write operation cannot finish in a specific time

request-level-timeout: 2 options
1) using reactor operation called httpRequest & creating a lambda for the HttpClientRequest object and set responseTimeout
2) reactive timeout - at the end of a webclient chain add the reactor operation called timeout(Duration.ofSeconds)
option 1 will override any settings set by the bean in the HttpClient object
option 2 does not override, but applies to the whole operation
