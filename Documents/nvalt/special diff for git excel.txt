Adding an excel diff tool for git to call.

I used a free tool from https://github.com/na-ka-na/ExcelCompare.

1. Placed their script executable (excel_cmp) in my ~/.bin with their dist (contains needed jar files)
2. .bin is in my path already
3. Created a ~/.config/git/attributes file with
    *.xls   diff=excel
    *.xlsx  diff=excel
4. Added to my ~/.gitconfig
    [diff "excel"]
        command = excel_cmp
