As to more dynamic filtering, you could read this blog entry(http://www.cowtowncoder.com/blog/archives/2011/02/entry_443.html) which includes standard methods. @JsonView works if you have sets of static definitions (one of which you can dynamically select on per-serialization basis), but if you want yet more dynamic system, @JsonFilter is the way to go.

Alternatively, another relatively simple way would be to first "convert" your POJO into a Map:


Map props = objectMapper.convertValue(pojo, Map.class);

(which is similar to serializing it as JSON, except that result is a Map which would render as JSON)

and then selectively trim Map, and serialize that as JSON. Or, if you prefer, you can use JsonNode ("tree model") as the intermediate thing to modify and then serialize.
