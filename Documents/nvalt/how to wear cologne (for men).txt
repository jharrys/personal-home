* Keep and store cologne in a cool, dray area way from direct sunlight
* Apply fragrance low on boday - on your chest and neck so that the scent rises and you won't lose it as quickly
* Do NOT spray on wrists
* Do not exceed more than 3 sprays
* I've found this depends on the perfume and your chemistry; lighter woodier ones that don't last as long may need secondary applications
* Re-apply after long periods (i.e., morning and then mid-afternoon to evening)
* Job interviews - none are best
* A little sweat with your cologne can go a long way if your pH and chemistry aligns with the particular frangrance
* Test on yourself and learn how it mixes with your pH.

* My daytime (43 years old, 2012/2013) - Gucci, Pour Homme II
* Night time (43 years old, 2012/2013) - Polo Double Dark (my favorite - musky and spicy); Dolce & Gabana, The One musky, spicy but a warm, woody undertone that women told me they like - feels like making them snuggle near a warm fire with you)
