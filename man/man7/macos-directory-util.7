dirutil - notes on macos\[cq] directory utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
Directory Utility.app \&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
MacOS offers two utilities for working with directories such as LDAP or
Microsoft\[cq]s AD.
.PP
Note that MacOS is also based on NextStep which used Netinfo in the
beginning.
.PP
Utility 1 is \f[I]Directory Utility.app\f[R] which is a UI based
utility.
It automatically uses Kerberos, so you can connect to NTML/KRB
naturally.
You can look in the log file krb5.log for details about how it\[cq]s
trying to login.
.PP
With \f[I]Directory Utility.app\f[R] you must first \f[B]bind\f[R] to
the domain.
For example the domain for the church is \f[I]ldschurch.org\f[R].
Use your federated credentials to bind and then Active Directory should
be enabled and you should be able to execute searches within the UI app.
.PP
Utility 2 is \f[I]dscl\f[R] which is equivalent to the old netinfo.
Note that once you bind with the UI tool you can figure out the LDS
domain.
The command below lists all users within the LDS AD domain.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
dscl \[dq]Active Directory/LDS/All Domains\[dq] -list /Users
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In addition, \f[I]dscl\f[R] is interactive in the cli.
Just type the command without parameters and you\[cq]ll be in
interactive mode.
You can use the help to figure out details.
