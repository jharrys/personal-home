Instructions on setting up a new Windows for Johnnie Harris (be it Work or Home).
I use Cygwin as my base for generified system configuration and symbolic linking to important directories based
on system type. Currently two types of systems, Linux and Windows. I haven't had a Mac system to test for many years.

1. Install Cygwin
  a. Install 64-bit Cygwin to c:\cygwin
  b. If you need 32-bit install to c:\cygwin32
  c. Home directory should be c:\cygwin\home\lpjharri (scripts symlink to this absolute path)
2. Install git package
3. Install bash-git-completion package
4. Add your .ssh directory
  a. Ensure you have the key pair titled github_rsa (current as of 3/23/2015) - this is the key pair used by my bitbucket.org account
  b. Ensure .corkscrew-auth has correct credentials for the proxy server you need to get past
5. Clone your Cygwin home directory from git@bitbucket.org:jharrys/my_home_dir.git
6. Make sure your Cygwin home directory is completely up-to-date with your upstream git repository
7. Execute the necessary scripts to create all the appropriate symbolic links
  a. As of 3/23/2015, these symbolic links are up-to-date for a Windows 8.1 system
  b. This should also work under a Windows 7 system
  c. No testing has been done for a Windows 10 system
8.
