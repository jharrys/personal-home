    ;   indent-with-non-tab : treats a line that is indented with 8 or more space chars as an error (NOT enabled by default)
    ;   blank-at-eof : treats blank lines added at the end of file as an error (enabled by default)
    ;   trailing-space : a short-hand to cover both blank-at-eol and blank-at-eof
