You are dealing with difficult things and I know we can be hard to handle at times, and I apologize for that. I do see the tough things you are dealing with. It's in our nature as architects to question and push things - but I should tell you more that I appreciate you and your kindness and your leadership. Sincerely, thank you.</span></span><br/>
