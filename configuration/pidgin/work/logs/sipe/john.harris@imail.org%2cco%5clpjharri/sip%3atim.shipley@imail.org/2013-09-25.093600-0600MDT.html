I'm asking this as a friend and not as a formal request to my TL until I hear your advice. I would like to take my lunch hour to drive down to provo and fix some personal things, and then work the rest of the day from home. But I don't even want to make the request if you believe my T &amp; A is still shaky or Lonnie is still frustrated with me.</span></span><br/>
