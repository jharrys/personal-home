<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(4:44:57 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>difficult time ... very confused. the dates made me very aware that my wife left me - I really wanted to be with her for the rest of my life - I was happy - and I loved her. I'm finding it difficult not to cry.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(4:48:55 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I was thinking that ... but I don't have to tell you how lonely it is. And I can't explain it to my married friends or my parents ... it's a loneliness for the companionship of a spouse or a friend that you are attracted to.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(4:52:24 PM)</font> <b>Sara Curry:</b></font> <div style="font-size: 9pt;font-family: Comic Sans MS;color: #800080;direction: ltr">yes it is an emptiness a lot of people can't relate too. Especially people you may do processing your emotions with, because they get protective and they think you are better off now than with someone you have expressed has hurt you deeply. </div><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(4:54:12 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>thank you for letting me share ... I know I get deep with you, but you are an awesome listener and an even better advice giver ;)</span></span><br/>

<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(4:58:21 PM)</font> <b>Sara Curry:</b></font> <div style="font-size: 9pt;font-family: Comic Sans MS;color: #800080;direction: ltr">When I had my little dating experience, I thought of John often and I compared a lot.&nbsp; I thought how can I love someone else so much and be here and attempting a relationship with someone else, but I felt I had to move forward. </div><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(4:59:49 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>Yup - exactly. But at the same time you crave that same relationship and closeness ... and to make it worse I think I'm making some of my memories with my ex into greater experiences than what I really had.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(5:12:05 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>Yeah - that's the thing that's causing my head to spin ... my head says to go slow, but then I want some results but when I start getting results I start panicking that I'm going too fast!</span></span><br/>
