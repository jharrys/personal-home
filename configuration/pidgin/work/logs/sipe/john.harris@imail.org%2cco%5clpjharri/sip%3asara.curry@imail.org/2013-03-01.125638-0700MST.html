<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(12:57:43 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I don't know. I had a nice time with the date Stuart set me up on. She invited me to some singles activity that everyone in the valley seems to be going to up hot-tubbing in Crystal Lake.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(12:58:06 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I can't decide whether to put myself out there and go or not. I'm being shy or un-decided or something.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:01:40 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>She sounded fun and together. She's passionate about her muscle massage therapy (she is building up her business). She has goals and knows what she wants. Although it almost sounded like she doesn't need a man ... not sure if I'm reading more into that. She's open and bubbly.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#A82F2F"><font size="2">(1:02:42 PM)</font> <b>Sara Curry:</b></font> <div style="font-size: 9pt;font-family: Comic Sans MS;color: #800080;direction: ltr">it all sounds good.&nbsp; Just because a woman doesn't need a man doesn't mean she doesn't want one.&nbsp; </div><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:06:12 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I know, but I am conflicted. Recently the church had an article about how men have become 'optional' to women. With women become the majority in everything from 56% of the Ph.D's in the nation to 80% of the high school graduates - the man has lost its value. I completely saw this in my life. I bring no value, that's why my wife left me. But she still needed my money, so she took my free agency away and now I have to work or go to jail.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:07:18 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>So what do I really offer to anyone out there ... nothing. I thought I offered the love that we had grown up together with, but my love meant nothing.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:11:47 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I guess I've lost all confidence in that I can provide that. I'm so sorry to lay this on you - I hope it's ok we talk like this because this is outside of our work parameters :)</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:18:54 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I just had a thought ... you should become a psychologists that caters to the IT guy market - you understand guys and you understand IT guys in particular :)</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:28:06 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>let's complete the math ... you are going to live until your 85, that's 34 years! you finish at 59, you get your start and you'll do fine - then you hit 66 and get SS and your IH pension ... you'll have school paid off by 69, leaving you with at least 10 years of accumulated wealth.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:28:39 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>that's conservative estimates ... you know that.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:31:27 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>true ... I made the assumption you'd want to continue on as a way to keep yourself busy. once you have your own psych practice you get to choose your hours and how much time you spend, it's kind of like ... I'm bored so I'll take on some clients for a little bit, get extra income.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(1:37:51 PM)</font> <b>John.Harris:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I don't see why not. It makes sense, because as an architect you would be there for window dressing - this is more of a compliance and security exercise going line by line down the DSA. You will be more interested in the final outcome than in the process of getting to that outcome.</span></span><br/>
