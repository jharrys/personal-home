<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(3:51:49 PM)</font> <b>Johnnie:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>Stu's just a child ... Lonnie has to start treating him as such and ignore his crap.</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(3:54:54 PM)</font> <b>Johnnie:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>He's going to do what he wants and throw his tantrums like he does, can't do anything about it. Don't play, that's what little children want you to do ... ignore it.</span></span><br/>
<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(3:55:29 PM)</font> <b>Johnnie:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>you're only hurting yourself and adding to your stress .... just consider this</span></span><br/>

<font color="#16569E"><font size="2">(3:59:14 PM)</font> <b>Johnnie:</b></font> <span style='font-family: Tahoma;'><span style='color: #3b4578;'>I know, you are exactly right and Lonnie is doing this team a disservice by treating you this way.
